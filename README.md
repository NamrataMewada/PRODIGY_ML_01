# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
### Overview
This project involves building a model to predict house prices using linear regression. The model is trained on historical data of house features and their corresponding prices to learn the relationship between them. The trained model can then predict the price of a house given its square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms.

### Dataset
Considered features from the dataset for price prediction
* GrLivArea: Square footage of the house
* BedroomAbvGr: Number of bedrooms
* FullBath: Number of bathrooms
* SalePrice: Sale price of the house
